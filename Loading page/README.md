# Loading Page Project

This project is a **Loading Page** that displays a rotating logo as a loading indicator while the page content is being loaded. The background of the page is blurred during the loading process, providing a smooth and visually appealing user experience.

## Features

- **Rotating Logo**: The logo spins continuously to indicate that the page is loading.
- **Blurred Background**: The main content of the page is blurred while the loading screen is active.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Smooth Transition**: The loading screen fades out smoothly once the page is fully loaded.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Flexbox, Animations)
  - JavaScript (for simulating loading and handling transitions)

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](#) (replace with your live URL).

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lalelani-Eddie/loading-page.git
cd loading-page
```

### Step 2: Open the Project

Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the loading page.

## Usage

1. When the page loads:
   - A **rotating logo** is displayed on a **silver background**.
   - The main content of the page is **blurred**.
2. After the loading is complete:
   - The loading screen disappears.
   - The main content becomes clear and interactive.

## Customization

### Logo
- Replace the `footer_print02_NO_BACKGROUND.png` file in the project directory with your own logo.
- Adjust the size of the logo by modifying the `width` and `height` properties in the CSS.

### Loading Time
- Change the `setTimeout` duration in the `script.js` file to match your actual loading time.

### Blur Intensity
- Adjust the `filter: blur(5px)` value in the CSS to control the blur effect.

## Code Structure

- **`index.html`**: Contains the HTML structure of the loading page.
- **`styles.css`**: Contains the CSS styles for the loading screen, logo, and blur effect.
- **`script.js`**: Contains the JavaScript logic for simulating the loading process.

## Deployment

Deploy the project to a static hosting service like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1. Upload the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files to your hosting service.
2. Ensure the `footer_print02_NO_BACKGROUND.png` file is in the same directory or update the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag to point to the correct path.
